# Check out my fitness app

This project was built with React

A work in progress. Here I've created a simple fitness tracker app using React. I implented two different API's that work hand in hand. One API searches exercises based on muscle group. When the user saves a searched exercises, the name of the exercise is then passed to the second API and used to render a gif of exercise. I used Firebase on the backend to store sign up/login. Firebase is also implemented to store user's saved exercises. User then has option to create workout plans and track progress. To take this app for a spin click the sign-up button to create an account, then login. Enjoy
